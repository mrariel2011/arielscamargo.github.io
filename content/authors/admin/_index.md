I'm a person interested in the development of games, programs, and websites, as well as some other hobbies like animes, novels, and 3D modeling.

Before starting my technologist graduation in Jogos Digitais (Digital Games), I concluded a Computer Technician course integrated into my high-school education where I started learning about my interest in programming and resolving code-related problems.

During that course, I learned the basics of C# through Visual Studio, Web development through PHP/JS/CSS, Database through MySQL, and a few simple projects focused on mobile through the available software. Around the middle of my 2º year, I got into contact with the Unity Game Engine through a recommendation of a teacher, and basically, got addicted. After developing some simple game projects for study in midst of my schooling period, I found myself more and more into the area, to the point of seeking a graduation related to the field.

Against my expectations of my graduation, rather than finding myself trouble in projects, I learned more about the theoretical part of the game developing area. The narrative of the stories in the games, their art, the practices used for planning and documentation, as well as the logic behind the development.

After concluding my graduation, I allowed myself some time to review my older projects, noting the interesting yet outdated (or rather, messy) mechanics before gathering them in new projects with a refined version of the noted ideas.
